                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>I have working in the field of Instructional Design for about 4 years and now I am eager to start a new career as
                    a software developer. During the 4 years as an Instructional Designer, I have created and implemented highly
                    effective training programs, leveraging cutting-edge technologies and instructional methodologies to elevate the
                    learning experience for organizational learners. Prior to my ventures in instructional design, I served as a
                    Secondary Chinese Teacher at prestigious institutions such as Notre Dame Prep School & Marist Academy. In this
                    role, I not only imparted knowledge of Chinese language and culture but also implemented innovative teaching
                    strategies to optimize instructional time and enhance student retention.My academic background includes a Master
                    of Arts in Instruction & Curriculum from Michigan State University, further supplemented by a Bachelor of Arts
                    in English from Southwest University of China. Currently pursuing an Education Specialist degree in Learning
                    Technology & Design from the University of Missouri, and Grand Circus Coding bootcamp,I am preparing myself for
                    the exciting new adventure that is about start.</p>
